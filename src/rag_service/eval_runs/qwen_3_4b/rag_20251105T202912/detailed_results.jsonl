The PDPA came into effect in 2012, so data from 1920 would predate the Act. \n\nThe PDPA's scope is likely focused on data held by organizations, not private individuals. Also, the sections mentioned don't discuss private individuals' obligations. The user's scenario involves a private person, not an organization. Therefore, the PDPA probably doesn't apply here.

This is because the offence is determined by the use of personal data, not necessarily by the presence of gain. PDPA s.48E(3) clarifies that other laws may also impose obligations or prohibitions on the use of personal data.", "original_text": null, "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the penalty for improper use of personal data that results in harm but without proven gain. I need to look at the provided evidences to find the relevant sections.\n\nFirst, looking at PDPA s.48E(1), it mentions that if someone uses personal data without authorization and it results in harm, they can be guilty of an offense. The penalty is a fine up to $5,000 or imprisonment for up to 2 years, or both. The key points here are the harm and the lack of proven gain. The section says \"causes harm to another individual\" which matches the user's scenario. \n\nThe user's case doesn't mention gain, so the (1)(a) to (1)(d) conditions apply. The (d) part includes causing harm, which is exactly what's mentioned. The penalty is the same as when there's gain, because the gain part is optional. The other sections, like s.48E(3), talk about other laws not affecting this, but that's more about other obligations. \n\nSo the answer should reference PDPA s.48E(1) and state the penalty as fine or imprisonment. Need to make sure not to include any other sections that aren't directly relevant. Also, check if there's any mention of harm without gain in the evidence.

Then there's PDPA s.48(1) which mentions a defense for employees if they acted in good faith during their employment. \n\nThe key here is whether \"I didn't know\" falls under the defense in s.48(1). The defense there requires proving that the act was done in good faith, either in the course of employment or following employer instructions.

Let me check the evidence provided.\n\nLooking at PDPA s.53(2), it says that if the employer proves they took practicable steps to prevent the employee from doing the act, that's a defense. But does that mean the employee is automatically absolved? The section says it's a defense for the employer, not that the employee is cleared. The employee's liability might still depend on other factors.\n\nThen there's PDPA s.48(1) about the employee's defense. The employee can claim good faith, but that's separate from the employer's steps. So even if the employer shows they took steps, the employee might still be liable if they didn't act in good faith.\n\nThe user might be confused about whether the employer's proof of steps is enough to absolve the employee. The answer should clarify that while the employer's proof is a defense, it doesn't automatically absolve the employee. Other factors like the employee's good faith (as per s.48) still apply. Also, s.53(1) says the employer is liable for the employee's acts, so even with steps taken, the employer might still be responsible.

So if the chatbot is acting on the company's behalf, the company might be responsible.\n\nThen there's PDPA s.48A(4), which talks about telecom providers. If the third-party API is a telecom service provider, they might not be considered as sending the message.

Then PDPA s.26D(6) mentions that they don't have to notify individuals if a law enforcement agency instructs or the Commission directs. But the question is about who must be informed, so the default is that the organization must notify the affected individuals. However, there's an exception if a prescribed law enforcement agency instructs or the Commission directs. But the user's question doesn't mention any exceptions, so the answer would be that the organization must inform the affected individuals. Also, they have to notify the Commission as per s.26D(1), but the question specifically asks who must be informed, which would be the individuals. So the answer is the affected individuals, unless there's an exception. But since the user didn't mention any exceptions, the answer is the affected individuals.

Let me look through the provided evidences to find the answer.\n\nFirst, PDPA s.48O(1) says that a person who suffers loss or damage directly from a contravention can have a right of action. The contraventions mentioned include those under Part 4, 5, 6, 6A, or 6B, which are parts of the PDPA. Also, Division 3 of Part 9 or section 48B(1) are covered.

But the question is about who can bring the action, not the timing. \n\nAlso, PDPA s.9(1) talks about individuals appointed under section 8(1) or employees authorized by the Chief Executive conducting proceedings.
