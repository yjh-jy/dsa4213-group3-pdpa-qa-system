PDPA s.16(1) states that the data controller must implement measures to ensure the security of personal data. If a breach occurs at a data intermediary, the data controller must still assess the nature and severity of the breach and take appropriate action. PDPA s.16(2) requires the data controller to notify the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) and affected individuals if a breach is likely to result in significant harm.","When a data breach occurs at a data intermediary (other than one mentioned in section 26E), the data intermediary must notify the other organisation without undue delay.

"If a company collects work emails from a public website, must it comply with PDPA?","Under the PDPA, a company that collects work emails from a public website may be required to comply with the Act if the emails are considered personal data. PDPA s.2(1) defines personal data as information about an individual, and PDPA s.3 requires that personal data be collected fairly and lawfully. If the emails are collected without the individual's consent and for purposes not disclosed, the company may be in violation of the PDPA.","Yes, a company must comply with the PDPA if it collects work emails from a public website.

"If an employee mishandles personal data at work, is the employer treated as having done the act too?","Under the PDPA, an employer may be held responsible for the actions of their employees if the employee acts within the scope of their employment. PDPA s.12(1) states that a person is deemed to have done an act if they are acting in the course of their employment. Therefore, if an employee mishandles personal data within their job duties, the employer may be considered to have done so as well.","Yes, under PDPA s.53(1), if an employee mishandles personal data in the course of their employment, the employer is treated as having done the act too. This is because the employer is held liable for the employee's actions within the scope of their employment."
Does the PDPA specify what form the prescribed applications and confirmations must take?,"The PDPA does not specify the exact form that prescribed applications and confirmations must take. PDPA s.12(1) refers to ""prescribed applications and confirmations"" but does not define their form. However, PDPA s.12(2) provides that such applications and confirmations must be in writing. Therefore, while the form is not explicitly detailed, it must be in writing as per the statute.","The PDPA does not specifically specify the form of the prescribed applications and confirmations. PDPA s.40(2) allows any person to apply to the Commission to confirm whether a Singapore telephone number is listed in a register, but it does not detail the exact form required. PDPA s.48N(4) requires applications for reconsideration to be made in the form and manner required by the Commission, indicating that the form is determined by the Commission."
"If a private museum keeps data from 1900, does the PDPA apply?","The PDPA generally applies to personal data processed after 1 March 2012. Data from 1900, being pre-2012, is not covered by the PDPA. However, if the data was processed after 2012, the PDPA would apply. PDPA s.2(1).","[RERANK=1.759|RRF=0.032] [PDPA s.4(4)] The PDPA does not apply to personal data about an individual contained in a record that has been in existence for at least 100 years. Therefore, if a private museum keeps data from 1900, the PDPA does not apply to that data."
What can the PDPC regulate about mediation operators under the PDPA?,"Under the PDPA, the PDPC can regulate mediation operators if they are considered data fiduciaries or processors. Specifically, the PDPC may impose obligations under PDPA s.2(1)(b) regarding the handling of personal data. The PDPC may also require mediation operators to comply with PDPA s.2(1)(c) regarding the purpose limitation of personal data. However, the extent of regulation depends on whether the mediation operator is deemed to be processing personal data in the context of the PDPA.",I'm not sure; this appears outside the provided statute.
How are compoundable offences under Part 9 treated?,"Under the PDPA, compoundable offences are those that can be resolved through a settlement agreement between the accused and the authorities. PDPA s.34(1) provides that an offence is compoundable if it is not a summary offence and the accused is not a public officer. PDPA s.34(2) allows the accused to enter into a settlement agreement with the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to resolve the offence. However, PDPA s.34(3) states that the DPP may refuse to accept a settlement if it is not in the public interest.","Under PDPA s.55(2), the Commission may compound any offence under Part 9 that is prescribed as a compoundable offence by collecting from a person reasonably suspected of having committed the offence a sum not exceeding $1,000.

PDPA s.4(2) also prohibits the use of personal data for purposes other than those stated. Therefore, the PDPA does not allow the use of personal data based on unclear authority.",I'm not sure; this appears outside the provided statute.
"If another law also requires data breach reporting, does PDPA still apply?","Yes, PDPA still applies. PDPA s.25(1) requires data controllers to notify the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) in certain cases, regardless of other laws. However, if another law requires reporting to a different authority, the data controller may still need to comply with both. PDPA s.25(2) allows for exceptions in cases of conflict.","Yes, PDPA s.26D(9) states that subsections (1) and (2) apply concurrently with any obligation of the organisation under any other written law to notify any other person of the occurrence of a data breach.

"If the Appeal Committee confirms PDPC’s decision, can it still alter factual findings?","If the Appeal Committee confirms the PDPC’s decision, it generally cannot alter the factual findings made by the PDPC. However, it may review the legal aspects of the decision.

This allows the Appeal Committee to review and potentially alter factual findings even after confirming the overall decision."
"If a private person keeps old letters from 1920, are they bound by the PDPA?","No, a private person keeping old letters from 1920 is not bound by the PDPA.

If you reasonably secured your Wi-Fi and the unauthorized activity was due to third-party interference, you may not be responsible. However, if you failed to take reasonable precautions, you could be held liable. PDPA s.12(1) and s.13(1) may apply. Are you able to confirm whether you took reasonable steps to secure your Wi-Fi?","Under the PDPA, if your Wi-Fi was hijacked and messages were sent without your knowledge, you are not responsible. PDPA s.36(3) and s.48A(5) state that unless proven otherwise, the owners or authorised users are presumed not to have sent or authorised the messages. A telecommunications service provider who merely provides a service that enables a message to be sent is also presumed not to have sent the message, as per PDPA s.36(2).

PDPA s.16(1) and s.16(2) outline the responsibilities of data controllers and processors, including the duty to take reasonable steps to ensure compliance.","Under PDPA s.48(1), an employee may defend themselves in proceedings for an offence under this Part by proving they acted in good faith in the course of their employment or as instructed by their employer. However, this does not automatically mean that 'I didn't know' is a defence, as the employee must still demonstrate that their actions were in good faith. The specific defence under PDPA s.48(1) requires proof of good faith in the context of their employment, not just a lack of knowledge."

These duties can overlap with those under other regulations, such as banking laws, if the same event or action is subject to multiple regulatory frameworks. However, the specific scope and requirements under each regulation would depend on the nature of the data and the context of the activity.","[RERANK=0.425|RRF=0.030] PDPA s.26D(9) states that subsections (1) and (2) apply concurrently with any obligation of the organisation under any other written law to notify any other person (including any public agency) of the occurrence of a data breach. Therefore, PDPA notification duties can overlap with those under other regulations, such as banking laws."
Can organisations seek reconsideration of financial penalties?,"Under the PDPA, organisations may seek reconsideration of financial penalties if they believe the penalty was imposed incorrectly. PDPA s.22(1) allows for an appeal to the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC).

"If the corrected data is sent to other companies, must they also tell me?","Under the PDPA, if corrected personal data is shared with other companies, those companies must also inform you of the correction, as they are considered data recipients under PDPA s.14(1). This ensures you are aware of any changes to your personal data when it is shared with third parties.","Under PDPA s.22(2)(b), if an organisation sends corrected personal data to other organisations, it must do so unless those organisations do not need the corrected data for any legal or business purpose.

"If an employer proves practicable steps, does that automatically absolve the employee?","No, proving practicable steps under PDPA s.14(1) does not automatically absolve the employer. The employer must also demonstrate that the steps were taken in good faith and that the data was processed lawfully. PDPA s.14(1) requires both compliance with the steps and adherence to the principles of lawful processing.","Under PDPA s.53(2), if an employer proves they took practicable steps to prevent an employee from committing an offence, it can serve as a defence. However, this does not automatically absolve the employee; the employer must still demonstrate that these steps were indeed practicable and effective in preventing the act. The employee's liability may still depend on other factors, including whether the act was committed in the course of employment."
Can PDPC share confidential information if the individual involved agrees?,"Under the PDPA, the PDPC may share confidential information if it is required or permitted by law, or if it has the individual's consent. However, the PDPC is not permitted to share personal data for purposes other than those specified in the PDPA, even with the individual's agreement.

"If a company’s chatbot sends promotional messages using a third-party API, is the company responsible?","Under the PDPA, a company may be responsible for the handling of personal data if it has control or responsibility for the data. If the chatbot uses a third-party API, the company’s responsibility depends on whether it has agreed with the API provider to comply with the PDPA. PDPA s.12(1) and s.12(2) outline the obligations of data controllers. If the company does not ensure the API provider complies with the PDPA, it may be held responsible.","Under PDPA s.37(3), if the company authorises the chatbot to send promotional messages, it is deemed to have authorised the sending of those messages. However, under PDPA s.48A(4), a telecommunications service provider that merely provides the API service is presumed not to have sent the messages, unless proven otherwise.

What defences are available for improper use of personal data?,"Under the PDPA, improper use of personal data is a breach of PDPA s.12(1)(a), and the penalties for such a breach are set out in PDPA s.12(2). Defences may include proving that the data was obtained lawfully, that it was used for a purpose for which it was collected, and that appropriate safeguards were taken. However, the PDPA does not provide specific defences for improper use, and the burden of proof lies with the defendant to show that the use was lawful.","Under PDPA s.48E(2), a defence for improper use of personal data includes proving that the personal data was publicly available at the time of use, or that the use was permitted by law, authorised by a court order, or based on a reasonable belief in having the legal right.

Therefore, the admission of evidence in PDPA prosecutions remains governed by the general rules of evidence under the Evidence Act, not by section 52A of the PDPA.","No, section 52A does not change how evidence is admitted in PDPA prosecutions against associations or partnerships. According to PDPA s.52A(4), it explicitly states that Chapters 5 and 5A of the Penal Code 1871, as well as the Evidence Act 1893 and any other law or practice regarding the admissibility of evidence, remain applicable. Therefore, the admission of evidence in PDPA prosecutions against unincorporated associations or partnerships is not affected by section 52A."

Therefore, the PDPA may still apply to information about someone who died 5 years ago, as it is within the 10-year period specified in PDPA s.4(4)."
"If a committee member of an unincorporated association is charged, can they use the same legal defence the association would have?","Under the PDPA, the focus is on the protection of personal data, not on legal defences in criminal or civil proceedings. The PDPA does not address the availability or applicability of legal defences in criminal charges. Therefore, the question falls outside the scope of the PDPA. I’m not sure; this appears outside the provided statute.","Yes, a committee member of an unincorporated association can use the same legal defence the association would have, as provided in PDPA s.52A(3). This allows the member to rely on a defence that would be available to the association if it were charged with the offence. The member bears the same burden of proof as the association would."
What can PDPC order after reviewing a complaint?,"Under the PDPA, the PDPC may issue an order to correct, restrict, or delete personal data, or to require an organisation to take steps to protect personal data. PDPA s.16(1). It may also impose a fine or require the organisation to pay compensation to the affected individual. PDPA s.16(2).","After reviewing a complaint, the PDPC may confirm a refusal or direct the organisation to provide access to personal data or other information within a specified time under PDPA s.48H(2)(a). It may also confirm a refusal to correct personal data or direct the organisation to correct it in a specified manner and time under PDPA s.48H(2)(b). Similarly, the PDPC may confirm a refusal to transmit applicable data or direct the porting organisation to transmit it in a specified manner and time under PDPA s.48H(2)(c). Additionally, the PDPC may confirm, reduce, or disallow a fee, or direct the organisation or porting organisation to make a refund to the complainant or receiving organisation under PDPA s.48H(2)(d)."
What does PDPA require about staff awareness of complaint handling?,"PDPA s.14(1) requires that an organisation must ensure that its staff are aware of the procedures for handling complaints regarding the collection, use or disclosure of personal data. This includes informing staff of the process for raising and resolving complaints. PDPA s.14(2) further specifies that the organisation must provide staff with information on how to make a complaint.","PDPA requires that an organisation must communicate to its staff information about the organisation’s policies and practices related to complaint handling, as stated in PDPA s.12(0)(c). This ensures that staff are aware of the processes in place for receiving and responding to complaints."
Who can bring a private action against an individual for PDPA message offences?,"Under the PDPA, only the Personal Data Protection Board (PDPB) can bring a private action against an individual for PDPA message offences. PDPA s.34(1) states that the PDPB has the authority to take legal action. Private individuals cannot initiate such actions under the PDPA.","Under PDPA s.48O(1), a person who suffers loss or damage directly as a result of a contravention by an individual of any provision of Division 3 of Part 9 or section 48B(1) has a right of action. However, an action may not be brought until after the Commission's decision has become final, as stated in PDPA s.48O(2). The individual must be directly affected by the contravention to bring a private action."
Can the Chair nominate fewer than three members to hear an appeal?,"Under the PDPA, the appointment of members to hear an appeal is governed by specific procedural rules. PDPA s.24(1) states that the Chair may nominate three members to hear an appeal. Therefore, the Chair cannot nominate fewer than three members, as this is a mandatory requirement under the statute.","[RERANK=5.305|RRF=0.033] [PDPA s.48P(4)] states that the Chairperson of the Appeal Panel may nominate a Data Protection Appeal Committee comprising 3 or more members. Therefore, the Chair cannot nominate fewer than three members to hear an appeal."
Is it an offence to disclose confidential PDPC information unlawfully?,"Yes, it is an offence to disclose confidential PDPC information unlawfully. Under PDPA s.22(1), it is an offence to disclose or make available to any person any information that is confidential and is held by the PDPC. PDPA s.22(2) provides for penalties, including imprisonment for up to 5 years and/or a fine of up to $50,000.","Yes, it is an offence to disclose confidential PDPC information unlawfully. Under PDPA s.48D(1), if an individual discloses personal data in the possession or under the control of an organisation or public agency to another person without authorisation, and they know or are reckless about whether the disclosure is authorised, they may be guilty of an offence and face a fine or imprisonment."
When is consent considered 'deemed' even if I didn’t explicitly agree?,"Under the PDPA, consent is deemed to be given if the individual has not explicitly objected to the processing of their personal data. This is outlined in PDPA s.2(1), which defines consent as the active agreement of the individual. However, if the individual has not taken any action to object, their consent may be deemed to be given. PDPA s.2(2) clarifies that consent is not required if the processing is necessary for the purposes outlined in PDPA s.2(3). Could you clarify the specific context or purpose of the data processing in question?","Consent is deemed if you voluntarily provide personal data to an organisation for a specific purpose, as outlined in PDPA s.15(1)(a), and it is reasonable that you would do so. Additionally, from 1 February 2021, consent is deemed if the organisation collects, uses, or discloses personal data through notification, as stated in PDPA s.15A(1). This applies even if you did not explicitly agree."
