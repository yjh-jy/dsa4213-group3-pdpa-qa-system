First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Download from the 🤗 Hub
model = SentenceTransformer("sentence_transformers_model_id")
# Run inference
sentences = [
    'What orders can the District Court make to enforce a PDPC direction?',
    'Enforcement of directions of or written notices by Commission in District Court\nA District Court may, for the purpose of enforcing a direction in accordance with subsection (3), make any order —\n(a) to secure compliance with the direction; or\n(b) to require any person to do anything to remedy, mitigate or eliminate any effects arising from —\n(i) anything done which ought not, under the direction, to have been done; or\n(ii) anything not done which ought, under the direction, to have been done,\nwhich would not have occurred had the direction been complied with.',

embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# [3, 768]

# Get the similarity scores for the embeddings
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities)
# tensor([[1.0000, 0.8191, 0.3820],
#         [0.8191, 1.0000, 0.5352],
